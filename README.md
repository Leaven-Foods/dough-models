# Leaven Foods Dough Models

This is an open-source work in progress. In this repo, we are building models for our products that predict the amount of hours of fermentation will be needed depending on the fermentation temp, dough hydration, and the amount of our product added.

Guide:

1. code:
    * This contains all the code for building the models and results. 
2. data:
    * preferment-experiments.csv is our first data set for poolish only across a few temperatures and amounts of our product.
3. Results:
    * This has the results of our models in CSV and Excel format. Each file is labeled with the product it is for and contains temps in the rows, % inclusion of our product in the columns, and hours in the values.
